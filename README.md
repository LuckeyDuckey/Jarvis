# Jarvis
A personal AI assistant based on Tony Stark's Jarvis system, this is my fourth version of it i come back to it every so often when my skills have improved enough and i make changes to upgrade it, i also make use of the best models i can get my hands on. For now it has been put on hold in favour of other projects how ever it has a few fuinction going for it right now, the wake word engine is all my own and uses a CNN built in tensorflow, the text to speech engine is tacotron 2 model that i have custom trained, unfortunatly i cannot upload any of the models here as they are to large, the speech to text engine uses a method i wrote to try determine weather the user is speaking and when it thinks the user is not speaking the text is transcribed using openAI's whisper model. The plan in future is to combine all these models togeather along with a chatgpt style model to answer question and a classification model to know when a user is saying a command like "play music", then using all this togeather it should have the capabilities of a modern personal assitsant like alexa however much more personal with any custom function i would like. This will also feature a modern UI made using pygame to make the system feel more responsive and alive. This is one of my larger projects so it will be a work in progress with me working on it over time rather than all at once as there is many other smaller projects i would like to finish first.
